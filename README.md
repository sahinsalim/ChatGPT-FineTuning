<h4 align="left">
  
- First, you must create an API Key from [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). Remember, you should copy and take note of it the moment you create it as you will not be able to view it later.
  
- Then, you need to make a payment by visiting [OpenAI Billing Settings](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview). A payment of $5 will be sufficient initially.
  
- Afterwards, you can run the codes by downloading the necessary libraries with Python (Jupyter Notebook is recommended for this project).
  
- Do not forget to create a sufficient number of entries when creating your own dataset. The more examples, the better the results. </h4>
